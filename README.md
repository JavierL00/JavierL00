# Welcome to my GitHub profile! 😄

I'm a passionate ninth-semester student pursuing a degree in Software Engineering. During my free time, I dedicate myself to studying and honing my skills as a full-stack web developer. With over three years of experience in this field, I have gained extensive knowledge in developing applications using Java and Angular.

Throughout my journey as a full-stack developer, I have worked on various projects that have allowed me to strengthen my technical skills and gain a deep understanding of fundamental programming concepts. I have been involved in the complete development of web applications, ranging from creating attractive and functional interfaces using HTML, CSS, and Angular, to implementing business logic and managing databases using Java and frameworks like Spring or Java EE.

In addition to my technical skills, I have cultivated a strong problem-solving and debugging ability, enabling me to quickly identify and resolve challenges that arise during application development. I am an enthusiastic advocate of continuous learning and always seek new opportunities to expand my knowledge and stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in the field of web development.

I am excited to continue growing as a full-stack web developer and leverage my skills and experience to contribute to challenging and rewarding projects. Explore my GitHub profile to learn more about my projects and contributions in the web development world! 😎
